This is the Online Covid form that I wrote for Centre College this year.  It's currently in use and is built off of the Form_able interface
that I set up for building out future web applications/portlets.  While this project won't run with out a few more of our proprietary objects
it should give you a decent look at what we are doing.

The Default_View shows the forms and the various clearance screens.

The Admin_View is a copy of our current List_View from the larger Centre_View_Portlet we've been developing, but ultimately, they decided to not use it.
I've included the Admin_View as well as the webservices for it just to show what we are doing.  I've included a screen shot of the List_View for the 
Study Abroad process which also utilizes the Form_able Interface just to show you what it looks like for larger projects.

All of the above views are fully responsive.
